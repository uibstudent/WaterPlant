# WaterPlant
 
 An app that will help keep your plants watered!
 
 ## Set up
 
You need to have Android Studio, as well as the Dart and Flutter plugins installed to run this application on your machine.

See https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install for how to install these.

In Android Studio you need to set up a VM that you can run the app on. Once you've done that you can run the app by using Android Studio, Intellij or VS Code (with the Dart and Flutter extensions installed).
